# TimerPlus Plugin
A plugin which starts a timer using command

## Description

Now you can notify online players about something that will happen after a specific time period using command which will start an automatic timer.

## Commands

`/stimer help` => Gives a list of all the commands available.
`/stimer set [seconds] [reason]`=> Sets and start the timer. Giving a reason is optional.
`/stimer cancel` => Cancels the current timer
`/stimer cmd [command]` => executes command when timer finish counting (The activator only can use this)].

## TODO
- Command to tell the player the reason of starting the timer again (As the only way to know the reason for now is when the executes).

- More features.
