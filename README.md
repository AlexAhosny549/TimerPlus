# TimerPlus Plugin
A plugin which starts a timer using command

## General 

Now you can notify online players about something that will happen after a specific time period using command which will start an automatic timer.

## Usage 

`/stimer [time] [reason]` => Starts the timer. Giving a reason is optional

Note: [time] here is the number of seconds. /stimer 35 means 35 seconds, /stimer 180 means 3 minutes, /stimer 7200 means 2 hours, etc..

`/stimer [cancel]` => Will cancel the timer

## TODO
- Config file with new features.

- Command to tell the player the reason of starting the timer again (As the only way to know the reason for now is when the executes).
